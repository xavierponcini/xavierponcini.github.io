## Research Experience

### Honours Research
#### _University of Queensland_ Mar-Nov 2018

...


### Undergraduate Research
#### _University of Queensland_ Aug-Oct 2017

Prof. Ben Powell, Joshua Foo and I, contributed in the development of a theoretical basisby which Quantum Spin Liquids (QSLs) can be detected via Raman scattering. Applyingsecond quantisation and Fourier analysis we made progress in the determination of thestructure constant of a particular material which can be used in the characterisation of QSLs.

### Summer Research Scholar
#### University of Queensland

During this time Dr Joel Corney and I analysed the influence of measurement back-action on a Bose-Einstein condensate. A model was developed describing the systemusing stochastic differential equations. XMDS was used to simulate the interaction ofweak, medium and strong measurements of the system, visualising the dynamics of thesystems as paths in phase space. For this research i was awarded credit toward mydegree receiving a grade of 7.

## Industry Experience

### Machine Learning Engineer
#### _Max Kelsen_ Jul 18 - Current

Existing at the interface between novel research and industry application Max Kelsenapplies machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to provide customerbased solutions. My current project involves the implementation of machine learningin the genetic screening of patients for immunotherapy. The opportunity to implementexciting research to provide a direct positive influence on patients is an exciting prospect.


### UQ Industry Experience Scholar
#### _CSIRO_ Feb 17/18

Working with the CSIRO gave me an opportunity to explore how academic research canbe tailored to successful industry applications. My role was to evaluate the effectivenessof a low cost nitrate sensor with the goal of informing North Queensland farmers oftheir impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. During this time I worked closelywith laboratory technicians and computer scientists alike to conclude that the proposedsensor did not provide the required level of accuracy.


### Laboratory Tutor
#### _University of Queensland_ Mar-Oct 17

The opportunity to tutor laboratories for multiple subjects at the University of Queens-land (PHYS1001/PHYS1171) has demonstrated the value in having your understanding chal-lenged. Encouraging a fresh perspective on a topic and presenting it in an easy anddigestible fashion, fostering the growth of the students and myself simultaneously.
