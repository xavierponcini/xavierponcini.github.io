Working with the CSIRO gave me an opportunity to explore how academic research canbe tailored to successful industry applications. My role was to evaluate the effectivenessof a low cost nitrate sensor with the goal of informing North Queensland farmers oftheir impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. During this time I worked closelywith laboratory technicians and computer scientists alike to conclude that the proposedsensor did not provide the required level of accuracy.
