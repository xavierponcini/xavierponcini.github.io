A description of the series and the goals. Next we want to have titles based on the topic and time of the seminars.

## Lattice Models: 2019.1

A description of the topic and perhaps some motivation of why this is an interesting topic. New we want a list of the topics and perhaps the speakers of each? Maybe start with the prereading for each of the topics.
