The quantum field theory (QFT) seminar series takes place on a weekly basis during semesters at the [University of Queensland](https://smp.uq.edu.au/). The organisers of this series are faculty members: [Valentin Buciumas](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/6060/valentin-buciumas), [Ole Warnaar](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/210/ole-warnaar), [Jorgen Rasmussen](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/262/jorgen-rasmussen), [Masoud Kamgarpour](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/212/masoud-kamgarpour), [Travis Scrimshaw](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/3937/travis-scrimshaw). Students (of which I am one), are encouraged to prepare the weekly talks as a mutually beneficial learning experience. 

The topics of these talks are centred around understanding the mathematical aspects of QFT. Previous topics include: conformal field theory, affine Lie algebras,  quantum affine algebras, representation theory of Lie algebras, vertex algebras, quantum invariants of knots and links, finite W-algebras,  crystal basis and Hecke algebras. For the content of the past series please visit the [official QFT seminar page](https://sites.google.com/site/uqqftseminar/home).


## Lattice Models: 2019.1

A description of the topic and perhaps some motivation of why this is an interesting topic. New we want a list of the topics and perhaps the speakers of each? Maybe start with the prereading for each of the topics.
