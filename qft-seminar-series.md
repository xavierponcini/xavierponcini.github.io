The quantum field theory (QFT) seminar series takes place on a weekly basis during semesters at the [University of Queensland](https://smp.uq.edu.au/). The organisers of this series are faculty members: [Valentin Buciumas](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/6060/valentin-buciumas), [Ole Warnaar](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/210/ole-warnaar), [JÃ¸rgen Rasmussen](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/262/jorgen-rasmussen), [Masoud Kamgarpour](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/212/masoud-kamgarpour), [Travis Scrimshaw](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/3937/travis-scrimshaw). Students (of which I am one), are encouraged to prepare the weekly talks as a mutually beneficial learning experience. 

The topics of these talks are centred around understanding the mathematical aspects of QFT. Previous topics include: conformal field theory, affine Lie algebras,  quantum affine algebras, representation theory of Lie algebras, vertex algebras, quantum invariants of knots and links, finite W-algebras,  crystal basis and Hecke algebras.

## Lattice Models: 2019.1


Lattice models are charaterised by their description on discrete periodic structures. These models contrast those set on the continuum such as general relativity and quantum field theories. Despite the prima facie contrast between lattice models and QFTs, we will see how such differences evaporate when we take the continuum scaling limit of the lattice.

The application of lattice models first began in the description of statistical systems. This early pairing was natural considering the discrete and scalable nature of such models. Further success was demonstrated by lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) recovering the strong interaction when taken to the continuous limit. Lattice models have also been applied in efforts to quantise gravity. With notable contributions coming from loop quantum gravity and causal dynamical triangulation.

The ubiquity of lattice models throughout the field of mathematical physics is a testimate to the utility they provide. As such lattice models are a worthy subject of the QFT seminar series. The schedule is as follows:
