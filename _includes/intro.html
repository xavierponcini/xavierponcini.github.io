    <p class="lead">Hi, my name is Xavier I am a mathematical physicist living in Brisbane, Australia. I am currently finalising my PhD at the University of Queensland. My main area of interest is the study of statistical
      mechanical models that give rise to quantum field theories in their continuum limit. Other research interest include quantum control and machine learning, at <a href="https://maxkelsen.com/">Max Kelsen</a>
      we use the latter to attack the former two.<br><br>

        <li> I am currently working on a project to construct continuous representations of Thompson's groups via <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1607.08769">Jones' action</a>.</li>
        <li> See my most recent research output "<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.14462">Integrability of planar-algebraic models
        </a>", completed with <a href="https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/11590/jorgen-rasmussen">JÃ¸rgen Rasmussen</a>. In this work, we develop a general framework that assiociates a statistical methanical model
              to each planar algebra, we present sufficient conditions that imply that a given model is integrable and we show that, under very mild conditions, integrable models of this kind give rise
            to a <em>single</em> integral of motion. </li>
