    <p class="lead">Hi, my name is Xavier I live in Brisbane, Australia. I spend most of my time learning. My main area of interest is mathematical physics
      - the field in which I am completing a PhD. Other research interest include genomics, quantum control and machine learning, at <a href="https://maxkelsen.com/">Max Kelsen</a>
      we use the latter to attack the first two.<br><br>
    


    <h1>Updates:</h1>

    <ul>
        <li> I am currently working on a project to construct continuous representations of Thompson's groups via <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1607.08769">Jones' action</a>.</li>
        <li> See my most recent research output <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.14462">Integrability of planar-algebraic models
        </a> completed with <a href="https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/11590/jorgen-rasmussen">JÃ¸rgen Rasmussen</a>. In this work, we develop a general framework that assiociates a statistical methanical model
              to each planar algebra, we present sufficient conditions that imply that a given model is integrable and we show that, under very mild conditions, integrable models of this kind give rise
            to a _single_ integral of motion. </li>
