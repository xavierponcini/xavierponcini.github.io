A description of the series and the goals. Next we want to have titles based on the topic and time of the seminars.

## Lattice Models: 2019.1

A description of the topic and perhaps some motivation of why this is an interesting topic. New we want a list of the topics and perhaps the speakers of each? Maybe start with the prereading for each of the topics.

1. Let's see what this  
1. Appears 
1. Like [tab1](tab1.md)
1. Another [CV](CV.md)
1. And another [about](about.md)

Another list, surely it is numbered

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
   
Surely this isnt't

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
  
What does this look like?

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
